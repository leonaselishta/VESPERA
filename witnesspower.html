                    The PHANTASM is more than a machine; <br>
                     it's the continuation of an unbroken line of innovation, power, and relentless pursuit of excellence. <br>
                     Built upon the heritage of Lamborghini, <br>
                    it is the ENGINEERING of decades of mastery and design evolution,<br>
                    but with a twist of Gothams shadow.<br>
                    In a world where the line between myth and reality blurs, the PHANTASM emerges as a new legend —<br>
                     a symbol of precision, power, and the undying will to protect. <br>
                    Its place in history is not defined by the streets it conquers,<br>
                     but by the fear and respect it commands from all who dare to challenge it.<br>
                    It is not JUST a supercar. It is a living, breathing testament to a legacy of speed, fearlessness,<br>
                     and the unforgiving power of its creators.<br>
                    From this day forward, the night has a new ruler.<br>
                    The PHANTASM has arrived. </h1>
